# BigDatawithSpark_RainInAustralia

A project aims in applying Spark in building a full machine learning pipeline to:

-Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

-Build different classification models (LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, LinearSVC, GBTClassifier), each model with different parameters (hyperparameters tuning)

-Evaluate quality (using cross-validation and train/test split)

-Model evaluation (Evaluate different metrics: AreaUnderROC and AreaUnderPR).

The data that being used in this project can be found in https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package.
